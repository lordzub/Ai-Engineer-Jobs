    "job_summary": "About Muro AI Muro AI is transforming how the $2T construction industry plans and builds. Founded by Cornell alumni, ex-founders, and former McKinsey operators, we’re building AI agents that automate the most complex, manual, and costly phase of construction: preconstruction. We move fast, build with conviction, and obsess over delivering real impact to the people who build our world. If you want to shape how the next century of construction gets built, this is where it starts. Who You Are A true builder with 4+ years of technical experience. You’ve lived the 0→1 chaos - maybe you co-founded something, or led a team through the trenches. You know that the good (fast growth) and the ugly (2 AM patches) come with the territory. You’re scrappy, curious, and energized by uncharted problems. Why It Matters Shape a category. No one owns “pre-con AI” yet — we’re charting that map. Bridge two worlds. Effect changes in an estimator’s spreadsheet with multimodal models that understand construction documents. Drive impact. Your AI agents will help contractors close multi-million-dollar bids and save hundreds of hours per project. Your Mission Build agentic workflows that work. Create agents to complete multi-step construction tasks. Implement tool use for Procore APIs, Excel manipulation, and document generation. Build agents that read plans, update budgets, and generate RFIs autonomously. Ship production RAG systems. Process 1,500-page plan sets. Build pipelines that understand construction specs and drawings. Handle messy, real-world documents - scanned, rotated, hand-marked. Deliver semantic search that actually finds the door schedule on page 347. Embed with customers. Sit with estimators during bid week. Understand workflows, then turn “we manually compare 50 subcontractor bids” into an intelligent agent. Own the AI stack. Python services orchestrating model calls. Celery workers for long-running jobs. Vector DBs for semantic search. Context engineering, evaluation frameworks, and monitoring for quality. Dockerized workloads on GCP infra. Make AI reliable. Build evaluation datasets from real construction docs. Collaborate with SMEs to catch hallucinations and make models accurate enough for million-dollar decisions. Tech Stack AI/ML: LLM APIs, Agentic frameworks, RAG pipelines, Vector DBs, Langfuse Backend: Python (FastAPI), Celery, Node.js/TypeScript Infra: GCP, Docker, Supabase Data: PDF parsing, spreadsheets, computer vision, unstructured data pipelines Who Should Apply We want hands-on builders with 4+ years of experience delivering applied AI to real users. You might be: A Full-Stack Engineer hacking with LLMs who wants to go deeper A Forward Deployed Engineer who wants to build AI, not just integrate it An ML Engineer who wants to ship products, not just models A Data Scientist tired of notebooks who wants to ship production code A Founding Engineer or ex-CTO ready for the next challenge You'll Stand Out If You Have Built and deployed an AI feature with real users AEC industry experience Worked with computer vision or advanced OCR pipelines Fine-tuned a model with a custom-built datasets Roles involving coding + customer interaction (FDE, Solutions Engineer, etc.) Prior founding-team or 0→1 experience Real Talk You’ll own customer and agent implementations end-to-end. You’ll ship to production within days, not weeks. Specs will be half-baked - you’ll fill in the blanks. You’ll wear many hats: dev, architect, product, recruiter, and support hero. If you love making AI solve real problems for real people, you’ll thrive.

    "job_summary": "Granica is an AI research and systems company building the infrastructure for a new kind of intelligence: one that is structured, efficient, and deeply integrated with data. Our systems operate at exabyte scale , processing petabytes of data each day for some of the world’s most prominent enterprises in finance, technology, and industry. These systems are already making a measurable difference in how global organizations use data to deploy AI safely and efficiently. We believe that the next generation of enterprise AI will not come from larger models but from more efficient data systems . By advancing the frontier of how data is represented, stored, and transformed, we aim to make large-scale intelligence creation sustainable and adaptive. Our long-term vision is Efficient Intelligence : AI that learns using fewer resources, generalizes from less data, and reasons through structure rather than scale. To reach that, we are first building the Foundational Data Systems that make structured AI possible. The Role The Applied AI Research Team sits at the center of this mission. Your work will take the ideas emerging from fundamental research and turn them into practical algorithms, optimized pipelines, and production-ready systems that operate across petabytes of structured enterprise data. This is a high-ownership role for engineers who can think like researchers and build like systems experts. You will translate theory into measurable performance improvements and help define the foundations of structured AI. What You’ll Do Turn research into real systems Transform foundational ideas from Granica Research and Prof. Andrea Montanari’s group into scalable algorithms and experimental prototypes. Build the evaluation harnesses, metrics, and datasets that reveal real signal from research concepts. Define and refine the metrics that determine progress in structured AI. Invent and optimize algorithms for structured AI Develop efficient learning methods for relational, tabular, graph, and enterprise data. Prototype representation learning architectures and compression-aware models for large-scale structured information. Build high-performance learning pipelines Implement fast training and inference loops using PyTorch, JAX, or custom kernels. Optimize memory, compute, and data-movement paths with a focus on cost, latency, and throughput. Integrate symbolic, relational, and neural components Design hybrid learning systems that reason over structured data natively, not through text intermediaries. Collaborate deeply across teams Work with Research Scientists to validate hypotheses at scale. Work with Systems Engineers to integrate your algorithms into Granica’s core data platform. Work with Product Engineering to ship features that power live enterprise workloads. Iterate fast and measure everything Run controlled experiments, analyze performance deltas, and deliver results with clear benchmarks. Drive the loop from prototype to production, improving the system each cycle. What You’ll Bring Technical Depth Strong background in machine learning, probabilistic modeling, optimization, or distributed learning. Experience building and tuning algorithms for structured, tabular, graph, or relational data. Ability to reason from first principles about efficiency, scaling behavior, and information flow. Systems Ability Hands-on experience with PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or custom ML kernels. Strong Python skills and familiarity with systems languages such as Rust, C++, or CUDA. Experience with large-scale data pipelines, model evaluation frameworks, or distributed systems. Applied Mindset Demonstrated ability to turn theoretical concepts into performant, reliable code. Comfort working in ambiguous research environments while delivering measurable outcomes. Curiosity for how structure and efficiency reshape the next generation of AI. Bonus Experience Structured representation learning, tabular or multimodal models, or relational ML. Distributed data systems, query engines, or vector/embedding infrastructure. Open-source contributions or collaborative research bridging theory and production. Why This Role Matters The world’s most valuable data is structured . The current form of AI is not. Your work will help close that gap. You will design the primitives that enable efficient learning at global scale and help build the foundations of structured AI. This role has real ownership, immediate impact, and a long horizon. Why Granica Fundamental Research Meets Enterprise Impact.

    "job_summary": "Overview In this role, you’ll be embedded inside a vibrant team of data scientists. You’ll be expected to help conceive, code, and deploy data science models at scale using the latest industry tools. Important skills include data wrangling, feature engineering, developing models, and testing metrics. Responsibilities Discover data sources, get access to them, import them, clean them up, and make them “machine learning ready”. Work with data scientists to create and refine features from the underlying data and build pipelines to train and deploy models. Partner with data scientists to understand, implement, refine and design machine learning and other algorithms. Run regular A/B tests, gather data, perform statistical analysis, draw conclusions on the impact of your models. Work cross functionally with product managers, data scientists and product engineers, and communicate results to peers and leaders. Explore new technology shifts in order to determine how they might connect with the customer benefits we wish to deliver. Pay offered is based on factors such as job-related knowledge, skills, experience, and work location. To drive ongoing pay equity for employees, Intuit conducts regular comparisons across categories of ethnicity and gender. Qualifications Model Prototyping: The ML Engineer would be expected to build prototype models alongside data scientists. This may involve data exploration, high-performance data processing, and machine learning algorithm exploration. The ML engineer will be expected to come up with a rationale for model choice and come up with metrics to properly evaluate models. Model Productionalization: Works with data scientists to productionalize prototype models to the point where it can be used by customers at scale. This might involve increasing the amount of data used to train the model, automation of training and prediction, and orchestration of data for continuous prediction. The engineer would be expected to understand the details of the data being used and provide metrics to compare models. Model Enhancement: Work on existing codebases to either enhance model prediction performance or to reduce training time. In this use case you will need to understand the specifics of the algorithm implementation in order to enhance it. This enhancement could be exploratory work based off of a performance need or directed work based off of ideas that other data science team members propose. Machine Learning Tools: The ML Engineer would build a tool for a specific project, or multiple projects though generally these types of projects are decoupled from any one project. The goal of this type of use case would be to ease a pain point in the data science process. This may involve speeding up training, making a data processing easier, or data management tooling. Qualifications BS, MS, or PhD degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent practical experience. Knowledgeable with Data Science tools and frameworks (i.e. Python, Scikit, NLTK, Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, R, Spark). Basic knowledge of machine learning techniques (i.e. classification, regression, and clustering). Intuit provides a competitive compensation package with a strong pay for performance rewards approach. This position will be eligible for a cash bonus, equity rewards and benefits, in accordance with our applicable plans and programs (see more about our compensation and benefits at Intuit®: Careers | Benefits).

At AWS our vision is to make deep learning pervasive for everyday developers and to democratize access to AI hardware and software infrastructure. In order to deliver on that vision, we’ve created innovative software and hardware solutions that make it possible. AWS Neuron is the SDK that optimizes the performance of complex ML models executed on AWS Inferentia and Trainium, our custom chips designed to accelerate deep-learning workloads. This role is for a software engineer in the Compiler team for AWS Neuron. As part of this role, you will be responsible for building next generation Neuron compiler which transforms ML models written in ML frameworks (e.g, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX) to be deployed AWS Inferentia and Trainium based servers in the Amazon cloud. You will be responsible for solving hard compiler optimization problems to achieve optimum performance for variety of ML model families including massive scale large language models like Llama, Deepseek, and beyond as well as stable diffusion, vision transformers and multi-model models. You will be required to understand how these models work inside-out to make informed decisions on how to best coax the compiler to generate optimal implementation instruction. You will leverage your technical communications skill to partner with internal and external customers/stakeholders and will be involved in pre-silicon design, bringing new products/features to market, ultimately, making Neuron compiler highly performant and easy-to-use. Experience in object-oriented languages like C++/Java is a must, experience with compilers or building ML models using ML frameworks on accelerators (e.g., GPUs) is preferred but not required. Experience with technologies like OpenXLA, StableHLO, MLIR will be added bonus!

    "job_summary": "👋 Hi! We’re Jerry.ai. We’re building the first AI-powered AllCar™ super app to make car ownership affordable, seamless, and even magical. From insurance to repairs to road safety, we’re connecting the entire car ownership experience into one mobile-first platform. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M → 50M users next. We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our Core Marketplace Automation Team , building automation systems that let our users self-serve, stay insured, and get the smoothest experience possible. This is a rare opportunity to work on software that directly impacts millions of users , automate complex business processes , and shape the future of insurance tech. Why you’ll love working here Real world impact: Your code touches millions of end users every day. Our automation systems already handle complex tasks like document uploads/verification, policy changes, payment, cancellations, and renewals — now we need to make them faster, smarter, and more seamless. Meaningful work: Build tools that automate hundreds of human agent hours and scale our business efficiently. You’ll tackle different types of challenges every day, learning both the technical and business sides of our core products. Zero bureaucracy: Have an idea? Pitch it, implement it, and see it live in days. No red tape, no slow-moving processes. Brilliant + supportive teammates: Work with talented and kind engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Be in an environment that encourages challenging the status quo, innovation, collaboration, and helping each other succeed. Flexibility: Work on projects that excite you. Explore new technologies, like AI/LLM tools, early — without bureaucracy slowing you down. Remote-friendly and flexible work arrangements allowing you to balance life and work, even internationally. Growth + learning: Engineers at Jerry get to take a ton of ownership, swim outside their lanes, level up quickly, and mentor others. Everyone is passionate, involved, and cares intensely about their work and their teammates. What You’ll Do Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end-to-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage. Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1–2 weeks on average. Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules. Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re-shopping experiences. Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero. Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention. Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack. Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture. What We’re Looking For Experience: At least 5 years full stack engineering experience building production-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast-growing consumer-facing software. Tech stack: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than having previous experience with specific languages or frameworks. Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly. Ownership: You take responsibility for end-to-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build. Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously across teams and time zones, with excellent communication skills. Curiosity + adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture. Our stack Frontend & backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo API: GraphQL Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda Why Jerry? This isn’t just another coding job — you’ll be solving real-world problems at scale , helping millions of people manage their most expensive (or at least second most expensive) asset more effortlessly. You’ll work in a flexible, fast-moving, and highly collaborative culture , where innovation is encouraged , your voice is heard , and the impact of your work is immediate .

    "job_summary": "We are developing advanced multi-rack, multi-tenant AI/ML datacenters with NVIDIA GB200, and upcoming GB300 GPUs. NVIDIA seeks a Senior Software Engineer for our CSP (Cloud Service Provider) Engagements team to focus on the cloud-native stack for datacenter products like GB200. In this role, You will define customer workflows, prototype stack enhancements, and debug the toughest Kubernetes + Slurm issues in multi-rack, multi-tenant AI datacenters. You'll tackle complex scheduling challenges across racks, tenants, and clouds as part of the CSP engagements team. What You’ll Be Doing Perform deep-dive debugging of multi-rack, multi-tenant clusters: scheduler behavior, container runtime issues, device-plugin crashes, RDMA/IB fabric anomalies, etc. Gather customer requirements and prototype feature extensions for Kubernetes operators, Slurm plugins, and custom micro-services that expose new GPU capabilities. Drive joint architecture reviews and “whiteboard” sessions with CSP and internal platform teams; convert findings into RFCs and upstream pull requests. Create reproducible testbeds (Helm/Ansible/Terraform) that mirror customer environments; automate validation and benchmark suites. Deliver technical collateral-design docs, how-to guides, demo scripts-and present at customer on-sites, KubeCon, and SlurmUG. Collaborate with AE, FAE, and Solution Architect teams to deliver integrated customer solutions and technical documentation. What We Need To See Strong source-level expertise in Kubernetes internals (scheduler, CRI/CNI/CSI, operators) and Slurm (federation, power-save, plugins). Hands-on experience integrating next-gen GPUs (Blackwell/GB200/GB300) or comparable accelerators into containerized clusters. Proven track record debugging large-scale, cloud-native stacks across networking (RDMA/RoCE), storage, and control planes. Customer-facing engineering or solutions-architect background: requirements gathering, PoC ownership, roadmap influence. Familiarity with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Tekton), observability (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry), and infrastructure-as-code. Excellent communication-able to switch between deep technical detail and high-level business impact. 6+ years of professional software development experience in distributed systems (Go, Rust, C/C++ or Python for tooling). BS or MS (or equivalent experience) in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or related field.

Domain-Specific Workflows: Tailor and deploy agentic applications across verticals — e.g., finance, healthcare, retail — addressing domain-specific processes via intelligent automation. Client Engagement: Conduct design workshops, POCs, and code-with sessions to shape data-driven agent workflows with stakeholders, fostering trust and adoption. Measure & Improve: Define and use key metrics, test harnesses, and evaluation plans to measure agent accuracy, latency, safety, and cost effectiveness. Knowledge Sharing: Craft reusable patterns, documentation, and best practices to influence internal assets and client roadmaps. Travel may be required for this role. The amount of travel will vary from 25% to 75% depending on business need and client requirements.

About Us Housed at Stanford Graduate School of Education, the Stanford Accelerator for Learning is the first university-wide initiative connecting scholars across disciplines and with external partners to bridge research, innovation, practice, and policy, and bring quality scalable and equitable learning experiences to all learners, throughout the lifespan. The Stanford Accelerator for Learning focuses on learning challenges most in need of new discoveries, evidence, and solutions and where we believe Stanford can make the most difference. Those include: adult & workforce learning, digital learning, early childhood education and development, equity in learning, learning differences, and policy & systems change. The Stanford Center on Early Childhood (SCEC) is an initiative of the Stanford Accelerator for Learning. The SCEC leverages the current moment of revolutionary science and fosters deep omnidirectional collaboration across sectors, seeking to change the way that research in early childhood is conducted, communicated, and utilized, with the overarching goal that each and every child thrives from the start.
